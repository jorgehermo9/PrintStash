"""Executor identity and liveness: which processes run work, and are they alive.

Every process registers one ``work_executors`` row and heartbeats it. The
heartbeat also renews the process's fences and publishes how many
write-capable operations it has in flight, which is what lets a restore drain
work running in *other* processes.
