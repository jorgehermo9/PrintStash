"""Upgrading into the job engine keeps what an installation already proved.

Two revisions cross this boundary: ``73abd9b883d9`` renames ``background_jobs`` to
``jobs`` (and every ``background_job_id`` to ``job_id``) and settles the jobs no
process will ever run again; ``a83ea973fad4`` reshapes ``jobs`` and carries the
thumbnail and metadata an upgraded library already has into
``artifact_derivatives`` before the tables that recorded them are dropped.

If this goes red, a self-hoster upgrading either loses Job history and staging
ownership, is left with Jobs that claim to be running forever, or has their whole
library re-rendered from scratch — or, on PostgreSQL, cannot upgrade at all.
