"""First ownership of an installation.

An installation is claimed exactly once, either from the browser (the account
and its storage in one request) or, with ``VAULT_SETUP_MODE=environment``, from
``VAULT_SETUP_ADMIN_*`` at startup (the account only; the owner signs in and
chooses storage afterwards). ``setup_policy`` decides which door exists. Both paths
serialize on the database so competing API processes cannot create two first
administrators.
