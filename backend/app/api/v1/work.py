"""Administration of background work: lanes, definitions, executors, failures.

The Background work page reads one overview and acts through these routes:
change a lane's concurrency at runtime (reset with ``null``), cancel every
queued Job of a definition, and re-derive a derivative kind ("missing" fills
gaps, "all" re-derives every Artifact of the kind). There is deliberately no
pause: withdrawing work is a cancel, and a cancel withdraws its intent.
