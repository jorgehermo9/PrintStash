"""E2E: an installation whose first administrator comes from the environment.

App-store forms (Unraid, Runtipi, CasaOS) and unattended deployments set
``VAULT_SETUP_ADMIN_*`` instead of opening the browser wizard. This drives what an
operator does after that install: startup provisions the owner, the owner signs in,
the server asks for the storage choice nobody has made yet, and after choosing it
the first upload lands in the library. If any step regresses, the installation is
either stuck without storage or has storage no one chose.
