# App-store catalogues

Source manifests for the stores that list PrintStash. Each one runs the
single-container image described by the root [`docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml)
and is submitted to that store's own repository. The Unraid template lives in
[`templates/printstash.xml`](../templates/printstash.xml), which Community
Applications reads directly.

| Store | Files | First administrator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unraid | `templates/printstash.xml` | **First-run setup** dropdown: `trusted_network` (default; register in the browser, fields blank) or `environment` (fields required) |
| Runtipi | `runtipi/printstash/` | `environment`, with required install-form fields, so the owner exists before the app serves a request |
| Umbrel | `umbrel/printstash/` | `environment`, with Umbrel's per-app credentials (`defaultUsername`, `deterministicPassword`) shown on the app's page |
| CasaOS / ZimaOS | `casaos/PrintStash/` | `trusted_network` by default; set `VAULT_SETUP_MODE=environment` and fill the fields to provision instead |

All of them map the store's form or credentials to `VAULT_SETUP_ADMIN_*`, which
creates the administrator once at first start (see
[first use](../docs/first-run.md#an-administrator-from-the-deployment)). The
administrator then signs in and chooses storage in the browser.

`VAULT_SETUP_MODE` names which door each store uses, and PrintStash checks the mode
and the credentials together (see
[first use](../docs/first-run.md#an-administrator-from-the-deployment)). Where
the store always supplies the credentials (Runtipi, Umbrel) the mode is
`environment`: the owner exists before the first request and the browser has no
door. Where the fields may be blank (CasaOS, Unraid) the default is
`trusted_network`, browser registration from the local network; switching to
`environment` makes the fields required. A combination that doesn't fit keeps
setup closed and the setup page names what to change.

`backend/tests/repo/test_catalogue_manifests.py` checks that every manifest runs
the unified image at the current app version, persists `/data`, uses the setup
mode above, never passes `VAULT_JWT_SECRET`, and wires the administrator
settings.

## Releasing: submitting and updating each store

The release commit bumps every manifest to the new version; the version test fails
until it does. Once the tag is published and the image
`ghcr.io/xiao-villamor/printstash:X.Y.Z` exists for `amd64` and `arm64`, each store
is updated as below. The release procedure in
`.agents/skills/printstash/references/release.md` runs these steps. Opening a pull
request in another project's repository is public, so the release confirms the list
with the maintainer first.

Check the image before touching any store:

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/xiao-villamor/printstash:X.Y.Z
```

The digest it prints (`sha256:…`) is what Umbrel pins.

### Unraid

Nothing to submit. Community Applications re-reads `templates/printstash.xml` from
`main`, and the template deliberately tracks `:latest`, the Community Applications
convention, so it is the one manifest the version test does not pin.

### Umbrel: pull request to `getumbrel/umbrel-apps`

That repository ships agent skills for exactly this: `umbrel-package-app` (first
submission), `umbrel-update-app` (every release) and `umbrel-test-app`. Follow them
in a checkout of the fork; they are the store's own contract.

1. Fork and branch: `gh repo fork getumbrel/umbrel-apps --clone`, then
   `git switch -c printstash-X.Y.Z`.
2. Copy `catalogues/umbrel/printstash/` to `printstash/`.
3. Pin the image by digest: `image: ghcr.io/xiao-villamor/printstash:X.Y.Z@sha256:…`.
4. **First submission only:** leave `gallery: []` and omit `icon` (the Umbrel team
   adds the official assets before merge), set `submitter`, and after opening the PR
   set `submission` to its URL. Mention in the description that the service uses
   `restart: unless-stopped` where Umbrel apps usually use `on-failure`: a restart
   requested from Settings is a graceful exit that can return status 0, which
   `on-failure` would not relaunch.
5. **Every release:** bump `version`, update the image and digest, and write
   `releaseNotes` from the CHANGELOG entry.
6. Test with `umbrel-test-app` (install on umbrelOS; sign in with the credentials
   Umbrel shows; choose storage; upload a model), then open the PR.

### CasaOS / ZimaOS: pull request to `IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-AppStore`

1. Fork and branch: `gh repo fork IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-AppStore --clone`, then
   `git switch -c printstash-X.Y.Z`.
2. Copy `catalogues/casaos/PrintStash/docker-compose.yml` to
   `Apps/PrintStash/docker-compose.yml`.
3. **First submission only:** add `icon.png`, `thumbnail.png` and `screenshot-1.png`
   next to it, and point `x-casaos.icon`, `thumbnail` and `screenshot_link` at the
   store's copies (see an existing app such as `Apps/Jellyfin`).
4. **Every release:** bump the image tag and `x-casaos.version`, and add release
   notes.
5. Validate with the store's own build, `./scripts/build_dist.sh`, which must finish
   without errors and write `dist/apps/PrintStash/`. Then open the PR, saying
   whether it is a new app or an update and how it was validated. The store's CI
   validates compose files too.

### Runtipi: the PrintStash app store

Runtipi's official store no longer accepts new applications, so PrintStash
publishes its own Runtipi app store. Users add the store's repository URL once in
Runtipi's app-store settings and then install and update PrintStash like any other
app.

- **Repository:** `xiao-villamor/printstash-runtipi` (to be created), with
  `apps/printstash/` at the root: `config.json`, `docker-compose.yml`,
  `metadata/description.md` and `metadata/logo.jpg` exported from
  [`icon.svg`](../icon.svg). Structure it following
  <https://runtipi.io/docs/guides/create-your-own-app-store>.
- **Every release:** copy `catalogues/runtipi/printstash/` into `apps/printstash/`,
  increment `tipi_version` (Runtipi offers the update when it changes), and set
  `updated_at` to the release time in milliseconds. Commit and push to the store's
  default branch.
- **Once:** list the store in Runtipi's community app stores discussion
  (<https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi/discussions/categories/app-stores>) and
  link it from the PrintStash documentation.

### Before a first submission

Install each manifest on a real host from your own fork or store first: Runtipi
custom app stores, Umbrel community app stores and CasaOS custom store URLs all
accept one. Confirm the whole first run: the owner signs in, is sent to the storage
step, chooses storage and uploads a model. Behind each store's proxy is where
`Host` handling is decided, and CI cannot see it.

The ports in `config.json` (Runtipi), `umbrel-app.yml` (Umbrel) and the published
port in the CasaOS compose file are host ports that must be unique within each
store; a store reviewer may assign different ones.
