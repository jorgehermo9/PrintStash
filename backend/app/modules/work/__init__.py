"""Background work: an engine-agnostic model of Jobs, lanes, sources and steps.

See ``docs/architecture/background-work.md`` for the design and
``.agents/skills/printstash/references/background-work.md`` for how to add or
change a job. The short version:

- The application database records intent; the engine only executes.
- The reconciler pulls pending work from domain state and is what guarantees
  it happens; a hot path only ``nudge``s the one definition it affects.
- Every attempt rebuilds its input from the subject row; nothing is replayed.
