"""Background worker: watch external-library folders for real-time changes.

For each external library whose ``watch_mode`` resolves to "watch" (see
``external_library.should_watch``), we keep one ``watchfiles.awatch`` task.
A burst of filesystem events is debounced and then simply triggers the existing
``external_library.scan_library`` reconcile — the watcher never re-implements
indexing, so all of the scan's safety guards (abort on unmounted/empty root, no
mass-delete) apply unchanged.

Watching only works on local filesystems; on network mounts (NFS/SMB/CIFS) the
kernel does not deliver inotify events. ``AUTO`` libraries on a network root are
left to their scheduled scan. When the user forces ``EVENTS`` on a non-local
root we fall back to watchfiles' own stat-polling (``force_polling``) so the
feature still works, just less efficiently.

A failed watcher never blocks startup or crashes the app: errors are logged and
the library falls back to schedule-only.
